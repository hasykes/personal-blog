# This Post was Written by ChatGPT-4 (AI)
## Foreward From a Human: 
Open AI's ChatGPT 3 model was originally released to the public in November 30, 2022 and has made changes for better (and worse) in under a year.  This post serves as an example of what a simple prompt to this technology can provide, but also where it falls short on the human elements.  Photo locations and descriptions were recommended by ChatGPT, while the actual photos were sourced via a quick pexels.com search.

The post was generated using 3 simple prompts, each of which compounded on the context of the entire conversation.  One of the most impressive things about these LLMs is the ability to extract sentiment from text and apply it to responses.  While the output may not always be factual - the predictive interpretation of what you want is impressively accurate.

### Prompt 1:
> Write a blog post called "This post was written by ChatGPT 4" detailing how you created the blog and giving background on AI and its future capabilities.  Provide other examples of AI (not just provided by Open AI).
>
>Write it in the style of Markdown and include free to use photos where possible.  The post should be ~500-1000 words broken into linkable sections

### Prompt 2:
>Give more substance to your sections (at least 2-3 paragraphs) and describe the different types of AI with a minimum of 3 sentences.

### Prompt 3:
>It still lacks substance.  Forget the original word count and write more prose. Feel free to remove sections as needed

### Introduction to ChatGPT-4

ChatGPT-4 is a powerful AI language model that can generate text that closely resembles human-written content. But how exactly does this machine create something as creative and nuanced as a blog post?

### The Process

1. **Input Processing**: ChatGPT-4 begins by understanding the user's input, breaking down the text into a form that can be understood by the machine.
2. **Model Computation**: The model then uses deep learning algorithms to analyze the input, learning from vast amounts of data to generate appropriate responses.
3. **Output Generation**: Finally, the machine translates these complex calculations into human-readable text.

### Pros and Cons

- **Pros**: ChatGPT-4 can generate text quickly, offer creative insights, and adapt to various writing styles and subjects.
- **Cons**: It lacks the genuine human touch, and there are ethical concerns regarding potential misuse.

## Background of AI

### Early Beginnings

AI's journey began in the mid-20th century, with the Turing Test, which sought to determine if a machine could exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human.

### Machine Learning

Over time, AI evolved into machine learning, where algorithms could learn from and make predictions based on data.

### Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Deep learning took this concept further, using neural networks to mimic the human brain's structure, leading to unparalleled accuracy in tasks like image and speech recognition.

### Different Types of AI

- **Narrow AI**: Excel at specific tasks but lacks general intelligence.
- **General AI**: A theoretical construct where machines possess intelligence comparable to human beings.
- **Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)**: Beyond human intelligence, ASI is a hypothetical scenario where machines surpass human intelligence in all aspects.

## AI's Future Capabilities
